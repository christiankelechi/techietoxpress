Creating a PDF reader with a custom voice reader sounds like an interesting project! PyQt is a suitable choice for developing a desktop GUI application. However, there are also other tools and libraries you can consider that may enhance your development process. Here are some suggestions:

Speech Synthesis:
To implement the voice reader functionality, you'll need a speech synthesis library. One popular option is the pyttsx3 library, which provides a simple interface for text-to-speech conversion. You can install it using pip install pyttsx3 and explore its documentation for usage instructions.

PDF Processing:
For handling PDF files, you can use libraries such as PyPDF2 or pdfminer.six. These libraries allow you to extract text from PDF files, which can then be passed to the speech synthesis component for reading aloud.

User Interface:
PyQt is a powerful framework for creating desktop GUI applications with Python. You can refer to the official PyQt documentation and tutorials to get started. If you prefer alternative options, you can explore other GUI frameworks like Tkinter or wxPython.

Learning Resources:
Here are some books and resources that can help you with PyQt development and related topics:

"Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt" by Mark Summerfield: This book provides a comprehensive introduction to PyQt and covers various aspects of GUI application development.

PyQt documentation: The official documentation for PyQt offers detailed explanations, tutorials, and examples. You can find it at https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/.

Online tutorials and courses: Websites like Real Python, Udemy, and Coursera offer Python and PyQt tutorials or courses that can provide step-by-step guidance for building GUI applications.

Stack Overflow: This community-driven question-and-answer website is an excellent resource for troubleshooting specific issues and seeking guidance during your development process.

Remember that completing a project of this scope within a month might require a focused and dedicated effort, especially if you're new to some of the technologies involved. Prioritize your tasks, break them down into smaller steps, and allocate your time effectively. Good luck with your project!
